TODO:

1) avoid writing the ticker and stock exchange by user itself...user just need to write the name of the company and 
   system automatically detects the ticker symbol and stock exchange.
  
2) maybe a user authentication and data storage in database...user can bookmark certain stock he likes and will get a email-notification on a 
   certain trigger..so rather than everytime filling the basic and advanced user form..he can directly view the graphs based on pre-selected criterions.
